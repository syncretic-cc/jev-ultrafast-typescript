# Ultrafast ⚡

**A browser agent with a dynamic, indexed action space.**

Give it one goal. [TypeSafe's Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) picks an operation and an element. A small LLM writes text only when the operation is `TYPE_TEXT`; passwords are typed by code, never by a model.

**Zürich → London on Google Flights in 7.1 seconds.** One natural-language goal, actual text generation, and loading waits included.

Measured with the prior Python implementation; see [Evidence and limits](#evidence-and-limits).

**Concepts.** *Jev* is TypeSafe's choice model: it only picks an operation and a target from the offered options, never strings. *Ultrafast* is the browser agent around it (this repo, `jev-ultrafast`); its runs, steps and errors are Ultrafast's, not Jev's. The *text helper* is the small LLM that writes TYPE_TEXT values. A *secret* is a password supplied by code, typed directly and never shown to any model.

## The action space

Every observation produces a new element table:

```text
[1] button    Change ticket type · Round trip
[2] combobox  Where from?        · San Francisco
[3] combobox  Where to?          · empty
[4] textbox   Departure          · empty
...
```

The operations are `CLICK`, `TYPE_TEXT`, `SELECT`, `SCROLL_UP`, `SCROLL_DOWN`, `WAIT`, `DONE`, and `BLOCKED`. Only supported operations and targets are offered.

```text
                      one TypeSafe request
                     ┌───────────────────────────┐
page → element table → operation                 │
                     │ click_target              │
                     │ type_text_target          │
                     │ select_target, if present │
                     └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                         use the matching target
                                   │
                    CLICK [7] ─────┤──→ browser
                TYPE_TEXT [3] ─────┘
                          ↓
                   small LLM → text → browser
```

Target questions are speculative. If the operation is `CLICK`, only `click_target` can execute. Two decisions, **one network round trip**. Each target head contains only compatible elements. Native dropdown choices carry an observed element/option index.

There are no site-specific action scripts or prepared field strings in the policy. The Flights example supplies a goal and independently verifies the outcome. The screenshot renderer adds labels afterward; it does not drive the browser.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syncretic-cc/jev-ultrafast-typescript.git
cd jev-ultrafast-typescript
cp .env.example .env
# Add TYPESAFE_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY.
deno task demo
```

Requires Deno 2.9+ and Chrome.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8766** and click **Start demo → Run automatically**. The inspector shows numbered elements, operation probabilities, target probabilities, and executed actions. **Choose next** pauses before execution.

### Connect Chrome

Ultrafast talks to Chrome through a small built-in DevTools Protocol client; there is nothing else to install. Its discovery order follows [Browser Harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness):

1. `BU_CDP_WS`: a full `ws://…/devtools/browser/…` URL.
2. `BU_CDP_URL`: an HTTP endpoint such as `http://127.0.0.1:9222`, for a dedicated automation Chrome started with `--remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=<separate-profile>`. `deno task demo:chrome` starts one on port 9223 with a profile under `artifacts/` and runs the demo against it.
3. Your everyday Chrome: open `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` and allow remote debugging. Ultrafast finds the `DevToolsActivePort` file in the usual Chrome, Chromium, Edge, and Brave profile folders. Accept Chrome's *Allow remote debugging* prompt when it appears.
4. Ports 9222 and 9223 on 127.0.0.1.

Empty variables count as unset. Ultrafast opens its own background tab and closes it at the end; that tab shares the connected Chrome profile, including its cookies and signed-in accounts.

By default the text helper calls OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-6-luna`) and `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` (default `none`). TypeSafe still chooses every action.

Set `USE_OPENAI=false` to use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint configured by `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY`, `TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `TEXT_MODEL` and `TEXT_MODEL_REASONING`. The recorded demo used this path with OpenRouter and `inception/mercury-2.5`, reasoning disabled; Gemini, GLM, and DeepSeek work the same way.

Password fields are hidden unless a password is supplied with the `password` Agent option or `JEV_PASSWORD`. Ultrafast then lists them with a masked value and types the password itself: it is never sent to TypeSafe or the text helper and appears as `••••••••` in history and the inspector. Keep the password out of the goal.

## Use it from another repo

Ultrafast is distributed on [JSR](https://jsr.io/@syncretic/jev-ultrafast) as `@syncretic/jev-ultrafast`. Add one pinned script to the consuming repo's `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "browse": "deno run -A jsr:@syncretic/jev-ultrafast@0.2/cli"
}
```

Put `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` and, for logins, `JEV_PASSWORD` in that repo's ignored `.env`. Start a dedicated debug Chrome (macOS shown; it uses its own profile):

```bash
open -na "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9223 --user-data-dir="$HOME/.ultrafast-chrome"
```

Then run:

```bash
BU_CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9223 npm run browse -- --url http://localhost:3100 --goal "Sign in with email testing@example.com and the configured password"
```

It prints one line per step and exits 0 when the run is done, 1 when it is blocked. `--json` prints the final run instead. Agents can call the same command.

## Use the library

```ts
import { Agent } from "./src/mod.ts";

await using agent = await Agent.create(
  "https://www.google.com/travel/flights?hl=en",
  "Find one-way flights from Zurich to London on September 20, 2026, " +
    "for one adult in economy. Stop when matching flight options are visible.",
);
for await (const state of agent.run()) {
  console.log(state.elapsed_ms, state.status);
}
```

Run with `deno run --env-file=.env --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env your_script.ts`. `await using` closes the tab when the block ends. The same policy can run a different task:

```bash
deno task example \
  --url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \
  --goal 'Find and open the Wikipedia article about Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.'
```

`deno task flights --keep-open` performs the flight search, checks the actual route/date/results, and saves its trace. It does not select or book a flight.

## Why it moves

- **One request per decision cycle.** Operation and target heads share the same observed state.
- **No screenshots in the default agent loop.** Jev consumes structured state. The inspector opts into screenshots; the video uses a separate continuous screencast.
- **One browser call per snapshot.** Read visible controls, their names, values, and text atomically. Keep references to the actual DOM nodes.
- **Validate the selected target.** Clicks check the document, form values, target, and nearby context. Animation alone does not force another prediction. Resolve current geometry and reject covered controls before input.
- **Wait for useful state.** After typing into a combobox, wait for visible suggestions, capped at 200 ms. Other interactions get at most two animation frames or 50 ms. These reads happen after execution is logged.
- **Keep hidden tabs rendering.** Focus emulation prevents background animation throttling without switching Chrome's visible tab.
- **Send visible text.** Offscreen article bodies and footers do not fill the model context.
- **Reuse an interrupted text request.** A generated value survives a stale-page retry only if the entire text-helper input is unchanged.

Every executed target is resolved from an observed node. The executor rechecks page freshness and click occlusion. Model output never becomes selectors, coordinates, shell commands, or executable JavaScript. Text-helper output must parse as a small JSON object before typing.

## Evidence and limits

> [!NOTE]
> Every measurement, recording, and source hash below comes from the prior Python implementation (last Python commit [`1231850`](https://github.com/syncretic-cc/jev-ultrafast-typescript/tree/1231850)). They were not re-recorded for this TypeScript port. The raw evidence in [docs/](docs/) is unchanged, so its source hashes name Python files. The committed media ([demo.mp4](docs/demo.mp4), [demo.gif](docs/demo.gif), and [flights-result.png](docs/flights-result.png)) were rendered by the prior Python renderer and have not been re-rendered with `scripts/render_demo.ts`.

The current video is a **7,073 ms** Google Flights run. Timing starts after initial page observation and includes model calls, generated text, browser work, stale decisions, and loading waits. A fresh independent check verifies the one-way setting, Zürich, London, September 20, 2026, and visible flight options. The video plays at 1×, with no opening hold and a 0.5-second final hold.

In six alternating runs with identical models and settings, both versions passed **3/3**. Median task time went from **9.450 s → 7.092 s**, a **25% reduction**; median browser protocol calls went from **1,092 → 101**. This is three repeats of one task on one browser profile, not a general reliability benchmark.

The same policy opened the requested Wikipedia article in **2.798 s** and passed a local hotel search/filter task in **1.896 s**. Runs, failures, Python source hashes, and measurement boundaries are in [performance.md](docs/performance.md).

A `DONE` choice still requires independent outcome verification. The DOM reader handles common HTML and ARIA controls, not the full accessible-name specification. Shadow roots, frames, canvas, uploads, pop-up tabs, nested scrolling, and arbitrary keyboard widgets remain outside this MVP. Owned tabs share the existing Chrome profile.

## Development

```bash
deno task check
```

That runs `deno install --frozen`, `deno fmt --check`, `deno lint`, `deno check` (including `src/snapshot.js` and `src/static/app.js`), `deno test --allow-read`, and `deno publish --dry-run`.

Tests are offline and need no credentials. `deno task guards` checks real controls in a local browser without model calls. Live examples and recording scripts make paid API calls. `deno task record artifacts/flights/<new-folder>` captures original browser timestamps; the folder must be new and under `artifacts/`, since tasks may only write there (the same applies to `deno task flights --output` and `deno task measure --output`); `deno task render <recording-folder>` renders that verified run at 1× and crops out the Google account strip (rendering needs `ffmpeg` on `PATH`). Credentials and raw traces stay ignored.
